# Python_Practice
Python based practice questions.

# Q1:
Create an algorithm in code that will calculate the factorial of a non-negative number **"n"** 

e.g. `print(factorial(10))` would output `3628800`


# Q2:
Create an algorithm in code that will find the highest value within an array like structure.

e.g. `print(findHighestVal([-10, -5, -15, -3, 1, 6, 9]))` would output `9`


# Q3:
Create a calculator in code with full normal calculator operations and at least 1 scientific operation (square root is rather simple so maybe choose that)

The calculator should ask the user for input values and what kind of operation it wants to do based on the operations symbol or short word e.g. `+ for add` `sqrt for square root`
