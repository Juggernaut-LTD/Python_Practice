# Python_Practice
Python based practice questions.

# Q1:
Create an algorithm in code that will calculate the factorial of a non-negative number **n** 

e.g. `print(factorial(10))` would output `3628800`


# Q2:
Create an algorithm in code that will find the highest value within an array like structure.

e.g. `print(findHighestVal([-10, -5, -15, -3, 1, 6, 9]))` would output `9`
